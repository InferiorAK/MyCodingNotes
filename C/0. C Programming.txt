Basic Special Notes:
---------------------
++m (prefix)  = It increments value of m first and then uses that value
m++ (postfix) = It uses that value first and then increments

"S" = When we use double quote, then it's a string Const
'C' = When we use single quote, then it's a Character Const

sizeof() = It's an Operator, not a Function. It tells us the number of bytes required to store in memory

& = Referencing Operator
* = Dereferncing Operator
%u = Unsigned Operator -> We use this for Adress, Cz Adress is always (+)ve Value
